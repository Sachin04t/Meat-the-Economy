### Project Description
Meat the Economy / Meatmerizor -  The Meatmerizor is a model that can predict the economic state of a country based on previous data of the country‚Äôs meat consumption and economic data.  
More specifically, the Meatmerizor takes in a country‚Äôs meat consumption per capita along with GDP per capita PPP for a given year in order to predict future trends. 

---

### Project Goals
Create a model to predict the country‚Äôs economic state based on the country‚Äôs meat consumption patterns.  
Find correlations between meat consumption habits of countries with upward and downward trends on GDP per capita PPP.

---

### Data Collection
National meat eating history (From Kaggle)  
Global GDP per capita, PPP data (From Kaggle)

### Preliminary visualizations of data
![Linear Regression Graph](Graphs/LinearRegressionGraph)

### Detailed description of data processing done so far
We filtered through and dropped the years that contained null values for GDP per capita per purchasing power parity (PPP) for a given country. Since only 5% of the data set contained null GDP per capita PPP, abstaining from
using the null years won‚Äôt have a huge impact on the analysis. Next, we combined the various meats consumed at each given year for each given country into a ‚Äúmeatball.‚Äù This accounts for various cultural, religious, and 
geographical differences between the countries. Ultimately, we wanted to look strictly at the amount of meat with relation to the country‚Äôs GDP per capita PPP along with the growth rate of each country‚Äôs meatball.

---

### Detailed description of data modeling methods used so far
We ran a linear regression model with the GDP per capita PPP as the dependent variable and the meatball data as the independent. 

---

### Preliminary results. (e.g. we fit a linear model to the data and we achieve promising results, or we did some clustering and we notice a clear pattern in the data)
We fit the linear model onto our data and we achieved a promising result. The model suggests that the bigger a country‚Äôs meatball, the greater their GDP per capita PPP.  Our r^2 value was 0.51 which further supports the
positive correlation between meatball and GDP/PPP.

### R^2 Results for Individual Meats
- R¬≤ for Poultry: 0.2709
- R¬≤ for Beef: 0.2062
- R¬≤ for Sheep and goat: 0.0279
- R¬≤ for Pork: 0.4859
- R¬≤ for Other meats: -0.0001
- R¬≤ for Fish and seafood: 0.1376

![R^2 Individual Meats](Graphs/R^2IndividualMeats)

- R¬≤ Score for Weighted Meatball: 0.5545

While the original meatball score provided a general signal (R¬≤ ‚âà 0.51), creating a weighted average based on individual meat type performance raised the model‚Äôs explanatory power to R¬≤ = 0.5545. This indicates that pork and poultry, for example, are more predictive of GDP levels than other meats like sheep or fish, and the model improves when this is reflected in the data representation.

### Kmeans Clustering results. (Meatballs and GDP per capita)
![KMeans Clustering](Graphs/KmeansGraphMeatball)

KMeans clustering revealed four global country profiles based on GDP and weighted meat consumption. One cluster captured low-GDP, low-meatball nations, often limited by cultural or structural barriers to meat access. Another grouped developing economies with rising meat intake, signaling growing industrial food capacity. A third cluster highlighted wealthy, high-meatball countries with Western-style diets and strong agricultural infrastructure. Finally, a small elite cluster included extremely rich nations with high meat diversity, reflecting both affluence and globalized consumption.

DBSCAN revealed micro-communities of economic/meat behavior that KMeans blurred out ‚Äî such as ‚Äúrich but moderate meat‚Äù countries (Cluster 2) vs ‚Äúrich and very meaty‚Äù (Cluster 1).

Small wealthy nations (e.g. Bermuda, Brunei) tend to form their own clusters ‚Äî likely due to tourism, imports, or elite consumption patterns.

Cluster 0 represents the bulk of lower-to-middle income nations, reinforcing meat as a luxury signal in global food systems.

Meatball score still matters: countries with scores over 30 consistently map to higher GDP clusters or noise (elite states).

Meanwhile, the highest GDP countries with low meatball scores didn‚Äôt even cluster well ‚Äî they were marked as outliers, reinforcing their uniqueness.
